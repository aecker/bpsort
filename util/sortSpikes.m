% Do spike sorting by fitting a Gaussian or Student's t mixture model.
%   [mu, Sigma, priors, df, assignments] = sortSpikes(b) fits a mixture
%   model using the features in b, which is a matrix of size #spikes x

%

%       Sigma           cluster covariances (D-by-D-by-K)
%       priors          cluster priors (1-by-K)
%       df              degrees of freedom in the model (Gaussian: inf)
%       assignments     cluster index for each spike (1 to K)
